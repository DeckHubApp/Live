# Slidable

This repo is the core website, as seen at [slidable.io](https://slidable.io). It doesn't actually
do very much at all; it's just an entry point into the wonderful world of possibilities contained
in various microsites/services. It's also a bit untidy; I really need to delete a bunch of the 
stuff that's in here.

Logging in and all that stuff is handled by the [Identity](/slidable/Identity) microsite, along
with some key sharing so that the cookies all work across all the different sites.

There's a one-field form on the home page to let people find talks, but that fires off to the
[Shows](/slidable/shows) microsite which does most of the good stuff.
