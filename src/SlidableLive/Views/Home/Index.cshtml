        <h2>About the project</h2>
        <p>
            Shtik is being built to bridge the divide between presenters and their audiences.
        </p>
        <p>
            Presenters can share their decks slide by slide; by the end of a talk, the whole slide deck will
            already be online. Currently this works with the <a href="https://github.com/shtik/cli">Shtik CLI</a>
            presentation tool, but a PowerPoint plug-in is in the works.
        </p>
        <p>
            Audience members can take notes right alongside the slides, and log back into Shtik later to review them.
            You'll be able to share your notes if you want, or keep them private if they're just for you. You can also
            choose to share them just with the presenter, so they can use them to improve the talk next time.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also ask questions through the site, instead of sticking your hand up in front of a room full of
            people. The presenter can see these questions through their Presenter View, and answer them on the spot,
            or come back and enter answers later on (even the best presenters don't know everything all the time).
            Or if you know the answer to a question somebody else asks, you can give it too.
